### **A decade of .NET. Now curious what happens when you point AI at enterprise data.**

Backend developer with a long track record in C#/.NET — diagnostics software, integration solutions, the kind of systems that quietly keep businesses running. Now exploring how LLMs can make that data more accessible and conversational.

#### 🔨 What I'm building

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧩 [**QueryCraft**](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/QueryCraft) | MCP server that gives Claude natural language access to OData services |
| 🐍 **AI/ML Toolkit** | Learning by building — Python, time series forecasting, data pipelines |

#### 🧭 Where I'm headed

- Making enterprise data **conversational**, not just queryable
- Figuring out where LLMs actually add value — not chasing hype, building proof
- Bridging the gap between backend systems thinking and AI tooling
